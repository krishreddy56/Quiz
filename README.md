# Quizmania
In this project we developed an open-system for some general users and enthusiasts of different fields where they can share their knowledge with others by creating quizzes which any other user can take to assess his/her knowledge on the subject. Users will also be able to select the categories in which they are interested in learning. A potential application for the portal includes instructors posting their quizzes and encouraging their students to take them via the portal. We used Agile methodology in implementing the project.
Technology stack: Angular 4, Spring boot, Junit, Mockito
